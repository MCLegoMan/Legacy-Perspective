![Perspective (LegacyFabric)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MCLegoMan/Legacy-Perspective/master/docs/img/titles/legacyfabric.png)
This project is in very early development.  
The source code in this repository is incomplete.  

## FAQ  
- **Why is the version of LegacyPerspective not match Perspective?**  
  - This source code is in early development, and should be treated as a different project for now.  
  - When LegacyPerspective is feature complete, I *might* update the versioning to match Perspective somewhat.  
- **Why start with 1.9?**  
  - Super Secret Settings was removed in 1.9 for "internal rewrites", I want to add it back.  
  - Other versions, such as 1.8 or 1.12 *might* get a LegacyPerspective version at a later date.
